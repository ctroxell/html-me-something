       <h1 id="toptitle">My Trip to France</h1>
       </div>
       <p>In 2016, I had the opportunity to host a student from France. Agathe, who is from a small city called Lille, came to stay with me for ten days. Other French girls were staying with some of my friends, too. Agathe and I became good friends and we had so much fun together.</p>
       <p>Agathe and I stayed in touch, and then in 2017 I went to stay with her for ten days! It was such an amazing experience, and I loved that it was more than a "vacation." I was actually getting to see what real life is like in France!</p>

       <h1>Our Weekend in Paris</h1>
       </div>
       <p>I arrived on a Friday, so we decided to spend the first weekend in Paris. While we were there, we did lots of sightseeing. I got to see the Eiffel Tower, of course. It was way bigger than I expected! We also took a tour of Notre Dame. It was huge, and there was so much to see inside.</p>

       <p>We walked up Montmarte and had lunch at a small cafe. The orange juice there was the best I've ever had! Outside there was a small plaza where artists gather to sell their work. I bought a small canvas from an old man with a big black dog. The dog was very sweet!</p>

       <p>One day took a bus tour on a double decker bus! I had never been on one before. The streets of Paris are just breathtaking. We also took a nighttime boat tour down the Seine River. At night, the Eiffel Tower is lit up. Seeing it twinkle from the boat was a something I'll never forget!</p>

       <p>I also got the see the bridge known for its padlocks. You have probably heard of it. Partners will attach a padlock to the bridge, where it is supposed to stay forever. Unfortunately, the weight of the bridge was too much and it started to give way. The bridge was blocked off, and the locks were being removed. I was looking forward to walking across it, but at least I still got to see it before all of the locks were gone!</p>
       <p>Paris had some of the best food I've tasted! Some of my favorites were Caprese Salad and croissants. They also had a lot of great little sandwich shops! I had the best bagel of my life while I was there!</p>

       <p>Back in Lille, I got to meet more of Agathe's family. Her neice, Cappucine, was so adorable! I also loved Agathe's dog, Iska! Everyone was eager to ask me questions about my life in St. Louis. It's funny to me because I consider my life quite boring!</p>

       <p>I also got a lot of questions from the kids at Agathe's school. The students wanted to know about high school in the US. They asked if we really take yellow busses to school. When I said yes, they were surprised! They thought that maybe that was only in movies. Agathe went to a private school, so they didn't take busses. Many of the kids rode their bikes. We always got a ride from Agathe's dad on his way to work. I was surprised to see how many kids smoked outside of the building before and after school. The students also asked about football games and cheerleaders. They were sort of disappointed to hear that, unlike in some TV shows, cheerleaders do not actually wear their uniforms to school everyday. I also got some questions about college parties. Although I hadn't even finished high school yet, I knew that college parties aren't really like the parties you might see in movies or on TV. The students seemed to be under the impression that college is all about partying! </p>

       <p>I had an amazing time in France, and I will never forget it. Agathe and I still talk now and then, and I am so grateful to have made a lifelong friend.</p>
